# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to conduct a thorough analysis on Amazon reviews. Because the data is so large, we need to conduct this in a database that can handle "big data". For this assignment, I chose the category "kitchenware" from the list of provided Amazon reviews links. 

Results: 

- total of 1,207 Vine reviews
- total of 97,839 non-Vine reviews
- 509 Vine 5-star reviews
- 45,858 non-Vine 5-star reviews
- 42% of 5 star reviews were Vine
- 47% of 5 star reviews were non-Vine

Summary: 

From the results above, there was no bias. Although users were paid to leave reviews, the majority of reviews were left by people who were unpaid. This is because if someone feels strongly enough about an item, whether they love it or hate it, they will talk about it. I believe non-Vine reviews are more honest. I would rather trust 45,858 non-Vine 5-star reviews because there was no motivation for them to post a positive review.
